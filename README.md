# Bank-Loan-Analysis - PROBLEM STATEMENT

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) REQUIREMENT
We need to analyze key indicators to gain insights for the overall performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:

### Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
### Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
### Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
### Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
### Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.


## GOOD LOAN V/S BAD LOAN KPIs

### Good Loan:
Good Loan Application Percentage. <br/>
Good Loan Applications. <br/>
Good Loan Funded Amount. <br/>
Good Loan Total Received Amount. <br/>

### Bad Loan:
Bad Loan Application Percentage. <br/>
Bad Loan Applications. <br/>
Bad Loan Funded Amount. <br/>
Bad Loan Total Received Amount. <br/>

### Loan Status Grid View:
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.’ By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.


## CHARTS

#### Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):  To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.
#### Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities.
#### Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
#### Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.
#### Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.
#### Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
#### Metrics to be shown: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

## GRID
Need for a comprehensive 'Details Dashboard' that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.
## Objective:
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
